# Citrea AI Agent

Citrea AI Agent is a revolutionary platform that combines drag-and-drop smart contract development with AI assistance, making Web3 development accessible to everyone on the Citrea blockchain.

## Overview

With Citrea-AI-Agent, we've created an intuitive platform that features:
- Drag-and-drop dynamic smart contract components
- AI-powered contract generation and optimization
- Automated security checks and best practices
- Seamless deployment to the Citrea blockchain
- Pre-audited component library

Our AI Agent assists developers by:
- Suggesting optimal contract structures
- Providing real-time code analysis
- Explaining complex blockchain concepts
- Detecting potential security vulnerabilities
- Optimizing gas usage
- Converting natural language requirements into smart contract logic

## Project Description

The Web3 space has traditionally had a high barrier to entry, with even minor coding mistakes potentially costing thousands of dollars. While companies typically spend substantial resources on smart contract audits, Citrea-AI-Agent democratizes this process through our AI-powered platform.

Using a sophisticated Retrieval pipeline trained on audited DeFi contracts from sources like Uniswap and OpenZeppelin, Citrea-AI-Agent combines drag-and-drop functionality with AI assistance to create secure, efficient smart contracts instantly. Our AI Agent ensures that best practices are followed and potential vulnerabilities are caught early in the development process.

## How it's Made

Citrea-AI-Agent is built with:
- Frontend: NextJS, Tailwind CSS
- Blockchain: Citrea Network integration
- Smart Contracts: Solidity with automated compilation via SolC
- AI Integration: Custom-trained model for smart contract analysis and generation
- RAG Pipeline: SIDAI's retrieval system for audited contract patterns
- Wallet Integration: Injectable wallet support for Citrea
- Security: Automated analysis and verification systems
